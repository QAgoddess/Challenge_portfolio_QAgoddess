# Task 1: Software configuration
## Subtask 1:Why did I choose to participate in the DareIT Challenge?
### I've participated in the DareIT Challenge first of all because I trust this organization. I believe that it is created by people who want the best for me. There are many courses and trainings, but this is why I have chosen DareIT. 
### I dream about changing my job to one that I will be proud and satisfied with. I think I deserve it. I've always been fascinated by programming, but I never went on that direction. I really regret it and I want to change it. 
### I think women excel in this field and I want to be one of them. My motivation is huge, so I'm not going to give up.
